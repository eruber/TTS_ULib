Dev Notes
---------
The LDoc tool for generating API documentation from Lua source code is using
Lua for Windows (LfW) which is currently stuck on Lua 5.1.

LDoc has a dependency on the Lua Penlight library and LauFileSystem, but both
of these are included with LfW.

Usage docs for LDoc is at: https://stevedonovan.github.io/ldoc/manual/doc.md.html

After using LDoc for awhile, found an issue and created an issue report, see
https://github.com/stevedonovan/LDoc/issues/301.

Have since fixed this issue in my own fork of LDoc, see https://github.com/eruber/LDoc.
My local LDoc forked repo is at:
D:\Devel\_lua_tabletopsim\__forks\LDoc

The original LDoc from GitHub installed at: D:\Devel\_lua_tabletopsim\LDoc-master.
This is the repo I forked.

Need Lua 5.2
------------
Because Tabletop Simluator uses as its Lua interpreter MoonSharp 1.5.0 which
implements Lua 5.2 features, I would like to execute Lua script testing using
Lua 5.2. However, LfW is still stuck on Lua 5.1.

So I am using a custom Lua build of Lua 5.2 for testing purposes, it does not
currently build Penlight (an LDoc dependency) though it does have LauFileSystem,
so that is why LDoc is still using Lua 5.1.

I looked at LuaDist, but it too is stuck on Lua 5.1.

See D:\Devel\_lua_on_windows\ReadMe.md for details on compling/building Lua 5.2,
had to download and install the MinGW gcc compiler to do the build. To build
everything do:

    cd D:\Devel\_lua_on_windows\luabuild-master
    build-all.bat

This compiles/builds its output to:

    D:\Devel\_lua_on_windows\luabuild-master\bin  -- lua interpreter exe, etc
    D:\Devel\_lua_on_windows\luabuild-master\lua  -- pure lua modules here (I copyied the PenLight lua files here under pl)
    D:\Devel\_lua_on_windows\luabuild-master\lib\5.2 -- static libraries (dll and a) files are here (like lfs.dll, winapi.dll, etc)

Eventhough I copied the bin contents to C:\Program Files (x86)\Lua\5.2 and made duplicate exe files without the '52',
the binaries are configured to look for libraries and lua modules at the above luabuild-master\lib\5.2 and \lua locations.

Building API Docs with LDoc
---------------------------
As per LDoc readme, created both an executable alias and a batch file alias to
call it:

cd docs

D:\Devel\_lua_tabletopsim\_my_dev\TTS_ULib\docs>echo lua D:\Devel\_lua_tabletopsim\LDoc-master\ldoc.lua $* > ldoc

D:\Devel\_lua_tabletopsim\_my_dev\TTS_ULib\docs>echo lua D:\Devel\_lua_tabletopsim\LDoc-master\ldoc.lua %* > ldoc.bat

Usage docs for LDoc is at: https://stevedonovan.github.io/ldoc/manual/doc.md.html

So to build the API docs:

    1. cd docs
    2. Ldoc . --verbose
    or
    2. make html
    However, sometimes when LDoc throughs an error and it has been invoked from
    the make.bat command, the console window closes, so I like to just use the
    Ldoc . --verbose command.

Eventually would like to develop my own customized templates and style sheets
for LDoc; for example:

    http://nilnor.github.com/textui/docs/
    http://lua4z.com/doc/
    http://stevedonovan.github.com/winapi/api.html

LDoc comes with three extra themes; ‘pale’ for those who like whitespace,
‘one’ for one-column output, and ‘fixed’ for a fixed navigation bar down the left side.

Since 1.3, LDoc allows the use of colons instead of @. However, you must either
use the --colon flag or set colon=true in your config.ld.
