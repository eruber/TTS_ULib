Dev Notes
---------
Using Lua for Windows (LfW) which comes with Lua 5.1.

We might have to investigate adding Lua 5.2 because I think Tabletop Simulator
ships with a Moonlight (Lua made with .Net) that is compatible with Lua 5.2.

Anyway, LfW installs to C:\Program Files (x86)\Lua\5.1 and comes with a lot of docs.

Going to use LDoc (Not LuaDoc) for documenting Lua API code:
https://github.com/stevedonovan/LDoc

LDoc documentation: https://stevedonovan.github.io/ldoc/manual/doc.md.html

LDoc has a dependency on the Lua Penlight library and LauFileSystem, but both
of these are included with LfW.

LDoc from GitHub installed at: D:\Devel\_lua_tabletopsim\LDoc-master

As per LDoc readme, created both an executable alias and a batch file alias to
call it:

cd docs

D:\Devel\_lua_tabletopsim\_my_dev\TTS_ULib\docs>echo lua D:\Devel\_lua_tabletopsim\LDoc-master\ldoc.lua $* > ldoc

D:\Devel\_lua_tabletopsim\_my_dev\TTS_ULib\docs>echo lua D:\Devel\_lua_tabletopsim\LDoc-master\ldoc.lua %* > ldoc.bat

Usage docs for LDoc is at: https://stevedonovan.github.io/ldoc/manual/doc.md.html

Eventually would like to develop my own customized templates and style sheets
for LDoc; for example:

    http://nilnor.github.com/textui/docs/
    http://lua4z.com/doc/
    http://stevedonovan.github.com/winapi/api.html

LDoc comes with three extra themes; ‘pale’ for those who like whitespace,
‘one’ for one-column output, and ‘fixed’ for a fixed navigation bar down the left side.

Since 1.3, LDoc allows the use of colons instead of @. However, you must either
use the --colon flag or set colon=true in your config.ld.
